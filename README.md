### My still growing portfolio:

* [https://awesome-cpf-validator.vercel.app/](https://awesome-cpf-validator.vercel.app/)
    * React + Next website
    * What's cool in there: RxJS for all the "animations".
* [https://noriller.github.io/Angular-FrontEnd/](https://noriller.github.io/Angular-FrontEnd/)
    * E-Commerce website made in Angular.
    * What's cool in there: Infinity scroll for product list, following button in the cart. 
* [https://math-quiz.noriller.vercel.app/](https://math-quiz.noriller.vercel.app/)
    * This was made during a online bootcamp like event. Most of the visual part was already there and I just forked it. Project made with React + Next.
    * What I did in there:
        * Homepage: you can't play other quizzes without giving a name.
        * "Back-end": based on parameters I set, I made a class that generates new challenges. Then using SSR, it revalidate the page with new quizzes with a 10 minute cooldown.
        * In the Quiz part:
            * It shows the right answer, with a different icon if you got it right or wrong.
            * In the result section, I show each quiz again with your answers and the correct ones when needed. Also shows the percentage of correct answers.
            * Also in the result section, I show a countdown timer that shows when new challenges will be available.
